# RISCV_Digital_Stopwatch_Timer

# Aim
The aim of this project is to design and create a versatile digital stopwatch and timer system controlled by a RISC-V. This system will serve as both a stopwatch and a timer. Users can switch between stopwatch and timer modes with ease(with the help of controller button), and a buzzer will provide auditory feedback for timer events.  
# Working
In this project using RISC-V which is connected to three 7-segment display, 2 push buttons, 1 buzzer, Controller button connected with led and power supply, start, stop and reset button. So in normal condition it will work as a stopwatch and we can start it using start and stop it with the help of the stop. To use it as a timer by pressing the controller button led will glow and we can set the timer using push button1 and push button2 and then if timer goes to 00 then buzzer will turned on. Using the reset button we can reset the timer.
