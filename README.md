# RISCV_Social_Distance_Detection

# Aim
The aim of this project is to design and create a versatile social distance detection system controlled by a RISC-V. This system will be helpful to measure social distance. User will be alarmed when distance will be less than 100cm and greater than 0. 
# Working
In this project using RISC-V which is connected to one ultrasonic sensor, one buzzer and one led. First ultrasonic sensor will start to detect the users/objects.  Ultrasonic sensors measure distance by sending and receiving the ultrasonic wave. Using the trigger pin it sends the the transmitted ultrasonic wave travels through the air and is reflected by hitting the Object/users.We know that the speed of sound in air is nearly 344 m/s, so using the speed, time and distance formula we can find the distance using duration. If user is nearer than 100 cm then buzzer will be turned on and led will also turn on.
